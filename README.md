# Youtube-view-predictor
This is a small but meaningful project I created while learning Machine Learning. It’s a YouTube View Predictor that estimates how many views a video might get based on some features before uploading. Although I’m still on my journey to mastering ML, every small step counts and brings happiness. 
# YouTube View Predictor 

This project predicts the number of views a YouTube video might get *before* it is uploaded, based on metadata like title length, tags, category, and publish time.

## Features
- Input key video metadata via a clean web form
- Predicts expected views using a trained Random Forest model
- Shows model accuracy graph and helpful instructions
- Responsive and user-friendly interface

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Fetch API)
- Backend: Python Flask API
- ML Model: Random Forest Regressor with scikit-learn
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Flask server: `python app.py`
4. Open `index.html` in your browser
